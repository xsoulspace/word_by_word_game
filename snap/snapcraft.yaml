  ----- Description -----

  Control the hot air balloon by entering unique words (within the level) based on the last 3 letters of the last word and bring it as far as you can!

  Features:

  - There is support for checking words in two languages (Russian and English). But if the word is not in the dictionary - you can add it.
  - You can play together with friends on the same device.
  - The game remembers the progress - if you press the menu (pause button in the center), the current game will be saved and you can continue later.
  - You can learn new words:)
