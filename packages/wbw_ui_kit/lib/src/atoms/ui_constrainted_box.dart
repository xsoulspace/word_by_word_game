/// A widget that applies size constraints to its child.
///
/// This widget wraps a [ConstrainedBox] to provide a more convenient API for
/// applying minimum and maximum size constraints to a child widget.
///
/// Use [UiConstrainedBox] when you need to enforce specific size limits on a
/// widget, such as setting a maximum width for responsive layouts or ensuring a
/// minimum height for consistency.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// UiConstrainedBox(
///   minWidth: 100,
///   maxWidth: 300,
///   child: Text('This text will be constrained'),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// PREFER using [UiConstrainedBox] over raw [ConstrainedBox] for a more
/// intuitive API when setting size constraints.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ConstrainedBox], the Flutter widget this class wraps.
///  * [BoxConstraints], which defines the constraints used by this widget.
///
/// @ai When generating layouts, use [UiConstrainedBox] to enforce size limits
/// on widgets, especially for responsive designs.
class UiConstrainedBox extends StatelessWidget {
  /// Creates a [UiConstrainedBox] widget.
  ///
  /// The [child] parameter is required.
  ///
  /// @ai Ensure at least one constraint is set when using this widget.
