# WBW UI Kit

The WBW UI Kit is a comprehensive set of UI components, typography rules, color schemes, and spacing guidelines designed for the Word by Word game. This guide will help you use the UI kit effectively and consistently across the project.

## Best Practices

1. Always use components from the WBW UI Kit instead of creating custom ones.
2. Stick to the predefined color palette and typography styles.
3. Use the spacing constants for consistent layout across the app.
4. When in doubt, refer to this documentation or consult with the UI/UX team.

## Contributing

When adding new components or modifying existing ones:

1. Follow the established naming conventions.
2. Document usage examples in the component's file.
3. Update this README if introducing significant changes.

For more detailed information on specific components, please refer to their respective documentation within the `lib/src` directory.
